        <p>Current feature status:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New theme! Now you're a lifeguard using frisbees to deflect water balloons that some jerk keeps throwing at people's sandcastles.</li>
            <li>Water balloons fall randomly, without targeting anything.</li>
            <li>Sand castles disappear when they are hit by a balloon. An explosion is displayed, but it never goes away.</li>
            <li>There is still no player interaction.</li>
        </ul>
